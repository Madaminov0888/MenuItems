QuickShot is a simple and fast screenshot application designed for macOS 15 and newer. 
Unlike traditional screenshot tools, QuickShot captures your screen without saving the image to your system. 
Itâ€™s perfect for quick tasks like copying screenshots to your clipboard for instant sharing or pasting them directly into other applications.
